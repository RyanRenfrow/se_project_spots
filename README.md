# Project 3: Spots

## Intro.

- Hey my name is Ryan Renfrow this project is titled Spots.
  This project is showing how to adapt an website based on it's screen size. Being able to decrease the size and change the layout to fit a phone whilst also being able to function properly on a desktop.
  Using @media allowed me to make the website adapt to the size.

  Image below shows the website in mobile view.

Some Key techniques/technologies -

I used the method of @import to add in blocks making the website much more clear and organized.
Implented the Poppins font via font.css to apply it across the board. Still having to adjust the font weight in each block according to figma.
As mentioned before I used @media to adjust the elements as the screen size changed. To a max-width of 627 pixels.
For the cards I used grid template over flex to have the layout form a proper column for what I needed. Flex helped me more so in spacing and aligning elements such as the new post button and profile picture.
I also used rgb color method instead of hex and names as the rgb method mirrored figmas. Also to make it more uniform/consistent in VSCODE.
I used the BEM Methodology in the project as well with the blocks, elements, and modifiers.
